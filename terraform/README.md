# Terraform configuration

## Note

To use the `pre-commit` hook, requires:

- [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

Place the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root directory of git repo, and run

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit install-hooks
```
